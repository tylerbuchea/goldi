## Complete

- ~~Given an API response you should show a company list.~~
- ~~Given an API response you should show company detail.~~
- ~~Given an API response you should show a discover feed which may link to company detail.~~
- ~~A company item from the list should be linked to detail.~~
- ~~Given a discover object, if it's a company video, it should be linked to company detail view.~~
- ~~Add a nav bar that handles those 2 actions (list and discover).~~
- ~~It's a good practice to cover your work with unit tests.~~
- ~~Try to write clean and self-explanatory code, (e.g. var X = 1; is not very descriptive.~~
- ~~Also any package or library that makes your life easier and the work cleaner is always welcome.~~
- ~~There is no need for visual tweaks but information should be ordered and readable enough also you may use any HTML/CSS framework to make it look good.~~
- ~~Just to let you know, re: CORS that our production env expects everything to come from the same domain, so that's how it's setup currently. So you'll have to setup a proxy either with express or nginx. Let me know when you think you might be able to have something back for us.~~
